## Top 15 Prioritized AI Use Cases for Dialog Finance

### 1. Enhanced Credit Scoring with Explainable AI (XAI) for Quick Loan
**Business Context**: Traditional credit scoring rejects underserved borrowers with limited formal credit history, limiting Dialog Finance's customer base and growth potential in Sri Lanka's expanding digital lending market.  
**Execution Strategy**: Implement alternative data sources (mobile usage behavior, social media footprint, smartphone analytics) integrated with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) XAI models that generate transparent credit assessments while complying with Central Bank of Sri Lanka regulations. Deployment begins with a pilot program collecting consent-based alternative data from existing customers, followed by gradual expansion across the Quick Loan product portfolio with clear customer education about data usage.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 25% increase in approved loan applications from previously underserved segments, 15-20% reduction in default rates compared to traditional scoring, 40% faster approval times, and compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks that require transparency in AI-driven decisions. Customer trust increases as borrowers understand specific factors affecting their creditworthiness.

### 2. Predictive Loan Repayment Optimization for Lesi Pay
**Business Context**: High non-performing assets (NPAs) and inefficient recovery processes for Lesi Pay digital loans reduce profitability and strain customer relationships, particularly when economic conditions impact borrowers' ability to repay.  
**Execution Strategy**: Deploy machine learning models analyzing behavioral patterns, payment history, economic indicators, and transaction trends to identify high-risk accounts before defaults occur. The system integrates with Dialog Finance's communication channels to deliver personalized repayment reminders with optimal timing and channels (SMS, app notification, call), along with automated rescheduling options based on predicted cash flow patterns. Begin with a segmentation of existing customers by risk profile, then implement phased intervention strategies.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 28% reduction in non-performing assets, 35% improvement in recovery rates for delinquent accounts, 22% decrease in operational costs for collections teams, and 18% higher customer retention among borrowers who receive proactive assistance. Customer satisfaction increases as borrowers feel supported rather than pressured.

### 3. AI-Driven Behavioral Nudging for Microsavings in Savings Pockets

**Execution Strategy**: Implement NLP and behavioral ML models to analyze user spending patterns, income fluctuations, and financial goals to deliver timely, personalized micro-savings prompts. The system identifies optimal "nudge moments" (e.g., after salary deposits, during low-spending periods) and adjusts message content, timing, and suggested amounts based on individual user response patterns. Start with A/B testing different nudging approaches across user segments.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 42% increase in active savings account usage, 30% higher average monthly savings contributions, 35% improvement in six-month savings retention rates, and 25% growth in cross-selling opportunities to customers building consistent savings habits. Users report feeling empowered rather than pressured to save.

**Execution Strategy**: Deploy AI systems that automatically extract insights from bank feeds, GST filings, social media footprints, and transaction velocity to assess business health. The solution integrates with Dialog Finance's existing SME onboarding platform, providing real-time scoring and recommendations while flagging high-risk applications for human review. Start with businesses in retail and services sectors with standardized transaction patterns.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 65% reduction in underwriting time (from 7 days to under 24 hours), 50% increase in loan disbursals due to faster processing, 25% improvement in risk assessment accuracy compared to manual reviews, and 32% higher conversion rates from application to approval. SME customers report dramatically improved experience with Dialog Finance.

**Execution Strategy**: Embed AI triggers within the Lanka QR platform that detect spending trends and offer instant assistance based on transaction data. When merchants experience low QR-based sales, the system analyzes patterns and provides actionable marketing suggestions through the same QR interface. Implement as an opt-in feature within the merchant dashboard, starting with simple insights before expanding to predictive recommendations.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 28% increase in merchant retention for Lanka QR services, 35% growth in average transaction volume per merchant, 42% improvement in merchant satisfaction scores, and significant new cross-selling opportunities for Dialog Finance's business products based on merchant behavior insights. The platform becomes a relationship-building tool rather than just a payment channel.

### 10. Explainable AI for Personalized Service Reallocation During Branch Closures
**Business Context**: Generic reengagement campaigns during branch closures fail to effectively migrate customers to digital alternatives, leading to customer attrition (estimated at 15-20%) and negative brand perception when physical locations are reduced.  
**Execution Strategy**: Analyze customer footprints, loan segment proximity, and digital product adoption rates to recommend intelligent service transitions when physical branches close. The AI system identifies which customers are ready for full digital migration versus those needing hybrid support, and suggests appropriate digital loan replacement packages with personalized onboarding. Begin with analysis of customers in branches scheduled for closure in the next quarter.

### 13. Conversational AI for Accounting & Reconciliation Queries in SME Banking
**Business Context**: Complex interfaces and manual reconciliation processes limit adoption of Dialog Finance's SME internet banking services, particularly among small business owners with limited accounting expertise who represent a significant growth opportunity.  
**Execution Strategy**: Deploy LLM-powered voice-based financial assistants that allow business owners to query balance sheets, schedule journal entries, or reconcile bank statements through natural language commands in Sinhala or Tamil. The system integrates with Dialog Finance's existing SME banking platform while maintaining robust security protocols. Begin with voice command functionality for common reconciliation tasks before expanding to more complex accounting queries.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 68% increase in active SME banking users, 55% reduction in support calls related to reconciliation issues, 42% faster monthly book-closing processes for small businesses, and significant increase in cross-sell rates for related business products. Small business customers report feeling more in control of their finances with reduced reliance on external accountants for basic tasks.

**Business Context**: Human analysis of customer feedback is limited to quantified surveys, missing subtle behavioral alerts and unreported frustrations that could guide product innovation and prevent customer churn.  
**Execution Strategy**: Use pre-trained transformer models to evaluate sentiment in customer feedback data across multiple channels (complaint logs, support calls, chat interactions, social media). The system identifies emerging pain points, emotional triggers, and unmet needs before they become widespread issues, with regular reports to Dialog Finance's product innovation team. Start with call center transcripts before expanding to written communications and social listening.  
**Expected Outcomes**: 35% improvement in product iteration speed based on actionable insights, 28% reduction in unexpected churn events, 40% more successful product features aligned with actual customer needs, and significant competitive advantage from anticipating market needs before competitors.
